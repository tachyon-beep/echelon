# Security Policy

## Scope

Echelon is an educational deep reinforcement learning environment. It does not handle:
- User authentication or credentials
- Sensitive personal data
- Network services beyond a local WebSocket replay viewer

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue, please open a GitHub issue. Given the project's educational scope and lack of sensitive data handling, transparency is preferred over private disclosure.

For issues that genuinely require private communication, contact: john [at] foundryside.dev

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version on the `main` branch is supported. This is a pre-release project under active development.
